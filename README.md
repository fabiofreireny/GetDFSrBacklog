# GetDFSrBacklog
Outputs a table with the backlog of all DFS replications. Most scripts will not count beyond 100 files, but this script gives you the full result.

- Optionally outputs to an HTML file (which auto refreshes if copied to a virtual directory and is opened in a web browser)
- Optionally outputs to a log file
